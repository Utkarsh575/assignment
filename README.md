This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Adding Your `OPENAI_API_KEY`

You need to add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file in the root of your project. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Steps To Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [VT323](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
